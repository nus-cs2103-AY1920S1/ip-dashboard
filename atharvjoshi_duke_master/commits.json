Duke can add, delete and change the \u0027done\u0027 status of these tasks. She can also inform the user when they have entered an incorrect command, input in a wrong format, or an unreasonable query. While Duke can perform these basic functions now, there remains scpe for improvement. For instance, instead of using switch statements to toggle between handling of different commands, perhaps enums might offer a more efficient way. Furthermore, all testing done on Duke has been entirely manual - I/O redirection to perform semi-automated testing might be another logical direction to extend this project in.\n",
